Operational Research Demo
-------------------------

Operational Research Demo is a GUI application which I've made for the (much hated) operational research course of the university.

It features an incremental UI by which I mean a kind of UI which the user can incrementally fill out as (s)he gives more and more information during the input rather than having to handle tons of pop-ups throughout the process.

I'd like to thank the professor for being merciful and giving me a D at the end of the course despite me cheating my way through this whole shit.

Enjoy!
