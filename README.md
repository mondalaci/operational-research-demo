Operational Research Demo is a GUI application which I've made for the
operational research course of the university.

It features an incremental UI. I mean on this a kind of UI which the
user can incrementally fill out as (s)he gives more and more information
during the input rather than having to handle tons of pop-ups throughout
the process.

I think it's a much more usable interaction model.
